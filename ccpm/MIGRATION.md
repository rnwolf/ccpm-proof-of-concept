## Migration Strategy

To migrate from the single file to this structure:

1. Create the directory structure first
2. Start with the domain model files
3. Extract the service classes one by one
4. Move visualization code to separate files
5. Update imports throughout the codebase
6. Create utility functions for shared code
7. Write integration tests to verify everything works together

This structure provides several advantages:

Clear separation of concerns between domain, services, and visualization
Easier maintenance as each file has a well-defined responsibility
Better testability of individual components
Simpler extension of functionality by adding new strategy classes or visualization types
More manageable code review as changes are isolated to specific files

Would you like me to start implementing any specific part of this structure? For example, I could show you how to extract the domain model classes or the buffer strategies into their respective files.


## Next steps for migration

1. Continue Migrating Functionality: Move more advanced features from the original code, such as resource leveling and fever charts.
2. Add Unit Tests: Create specific unit tests for each component to ensure they work correctly in isolation.
3. Improve Documentation: Add docstrings and type hints to all classes and methods.
4. Add CLI Interface: Enhance the command-line interface to allow loading projects from files, setting parameters, etc.
5. Validate Implementation: Compare the results from the new modular implementation with the original monolithic code to ensure they produce the same results.

This step-by-step approach allows us to gradually migrate the code while ensuring it continues to work correctly. Each component can be tested independently, and the integration test ensures that everything works together as expected.
