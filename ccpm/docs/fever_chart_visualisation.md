# Improved CCPM Fever Chart Visualization

## Enhanced Chain Differentiation

I've implemented several improvements to make it easier to distinguish between multiple chains of the same type on the fever chart:

### 1. Varied Visual Elements

Each chain now has unique visual characteristics based on:

- **Markers**: Different shapes (circle, square, triangle, diamond, etc.)
- **Line styles**: Solid, dashed, dotted, or dash-dot lines
- **Color variations**: Different shades within the same color family
  - Critical chains: variations of red (crimson, darkred, firebrick, etc.)
  - Feeding chains: variations of orange/yellow (orange, goldenrod, coral, etc.)

### 2. Deterministic Styling

The visual styling is deterministic based on the chain ID, ensuring:
- The same chain always gets the same visual treatment
- Chains of the same type get distinct visual representations
- The styling is predictable across different chart generations

### 3. Enhanced Legend

The legend now includes:
- Proper markers for each chain
- Appropriate line styles
- Color variations
- Clear labels that include both chain name and buffer name

### 4. Status Annotations

The final status points now include:
- Chain-specific markers (maintaining visual consistency)
- Zone-appropriate colors (red, yellow, or green)
- Text labels with:
  - Chain name
  - Status (Critical, Warning, or Safe)
  - Completion and consumption percentages

### 5. Offset Labels

Labels for status points are slightly offset based on the marker index to prevent overlap when multiple chains have endpoints in similar positions.

## Testing

The test script has been expanded to include:
- Multiple critical chains (to demonstrate differentiation)
- Multiple feeding chains (5 total)
- Different progress patterns for each chain
- Complete history with status updates

## Benefits

These improvements provide several key benefits:

1. **Better Visualization**: It's now much easier to track individual chains through the fever chart, even when there are many chains of the same type.

2. **Improved Readability**: The combination of different markers, line styles, and color shades makes each chain visually distinct.

3. **Clearer Status**: The enhanced status annotations make it immediately clear which chain is in which state.

4. **Reduced Confusion**: Even when lines cross or overlap, the consistent visual styling makes it possible to follow each chain's progress.

## Usage

The implementation remains compatible with the existing API, requiring no changes to how you call the fever chart functions. The differentiation happens automatically based on the chain IDs.
