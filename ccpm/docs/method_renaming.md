# Method Naming Conflict Fixes

## Problem Identified

We identified a naming conflict in the `scheduler.py` file:

- The file imports service functions from `critical_chain` and `feeding_chain` modules
- It also defines methods with the same names within the `CCPMScheduler` class
- This results in the imported functions being shadowed and unused, triggering linter warnings

## Changes Made

### 1. Renamed Class Methods to Avoid Conflicts

| Original Method | New Method |
|-----------------|------------|
| `identify_critical_chain` | `calculate_critical_chain` |
| `identify_feeding_chains` | `find_feeding_chains` |

### 2. Updated Internal Method Calls

Updated all internal method calls in the `CCPMScheduler` class:

- In `schedule()` method
- In `calculate_buffers()` method
- In other methods that reference the renamed methods

### 3. Method Functionality

The functionality remains unchanged:

- `calculate_critical_chain()` still uses the imported `identify_critical_chain()` and `resolve_resource_conflicts()` functions
- `find_feeding_chains()` still uses the imported `identify_feeding_chains()` function

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Eliminates Linter Warnings**: Resolves the `F811` warnings about redefinition of unused imports

2. **Improves Clarity**: The new names better indicate what the methods do from a scheduler's perspective

3. **Maintains Service Architecture**: Preserves the clean separation between:
   - Service functions (standalone, reusable functions that implement the core algorithms)
   - Scheduler methods (class methods that integrate the services into the scheduler workflow)

4. **Consistent Naming Convention**: The renamed methods follow a consistent verb pattern:
   - `calculate_*` for computing a new structure
   - `find_*` for searching and identifying components

## Testing Impact

Minimal impact on tests, as they primarily use the `schedule()` method, which internally calls the renamed methods. Any direct calls to the original methods in tests should be updated to use the new names.
