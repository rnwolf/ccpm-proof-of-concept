The implementation enables several important capabilities:

* Partial Resource Usage: Tasks can use just a portion of a resource (e.g., 0.5 Designer), allowing more efficient resource allocation.
* Resource Sharing: Multiple tasks can share the same resource as long as their combined usage doesn't exceed capacity.
* Multiple Resource Allocation: Tasks can request multiple units of the same resource (e.g., 2.0 Developers), modeling scenarios where more than one person with the same skill is needed.
* Backward Compatibility: The system still works with the legacy format where resources were specified as strings or lists.
* Improved Visualization: The Gantt chart display shows resource allocations in a user-friendly format.
